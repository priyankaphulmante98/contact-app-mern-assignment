# contact-app-mern-assignment

In this assignment, I successfully designed and implemented a full-stack contact management application. On the backend, I utilized Express.js to create an API for storing and managing contact information. This API supported basic CRUD operations, allowing users to retrieve, create, update, and delete contacts. Contact data was stored MongoDB database.

On the front end, I developed a React application that interacted seamlessly with the backend API. The user interface displayed a list of contacts, including their names, phone numbers, and email addresses. Users could add new contacts using a user-friendly form and could also edit, delete, update, and download PDF contact information as needed.

To enhance user experience, I incorporated search functionality, enabling users to quickly locate contacts by name. Additionally, I implemented sorting options, making it easy to organize and view contacts based on various criteria. This assignment demonstrates my proficiency in both frontend and backend development, as well as my ability to create a cohesive and user-friendly application for managing contacts.
